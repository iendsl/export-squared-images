# export-squared-images
A photoshop script to export all of your layers as PNGs with square dimentions that are powers of 2.
Uses photoshop folder and layer names for the file names, so be careful not to use any "/"'s in your names.
Also it stops working if your layer is larger than 16384 pixels.
It will let you chose a folder. That's about it.
